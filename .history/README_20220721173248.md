# Hack-FS project (NFTeach)

This is the project submission by team NFTeach. This app is a education platform that allows educators to upload content and create multiple-choice quiz based on content. The student can then consume the course content that the educator has uploaded and attempt the multiple-choice test. If the student recieves a passing grade (set by the educator who uploaded the test), there is an optionality to pay the educator a fee in MATIC and recieve an SBT that certifies that they have passed the multiple choice test.
