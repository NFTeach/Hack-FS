# Hack-FS NFTeachers Smart Contracts

This project is made in the context of Hack-FS hackathon.
The idea is simple, have an education plateform where educators can create courses and tests, and where students can learn and passes the tests.

Upon passing the test, the student can choose to mint a speudo Soulbound Token (SBT) that will:

1. Show the student completed the class and passed the test
2. Will act as a key to unlock new content (i.e. SBT for Chemistry 101 unlocks the courses and tests for Chemistry 102).

The student can also choose to not mint the SBT but that means the student has no achievement to display (i.e. nothing to put on a resume, ...) and can not access further content.
Not paying for the SBT will also be a great feedback for educators to see if their content is being deemed good enough to be paid for.

If the student decides to mint the SBT, the student basically pays the educator throught the minting price (fixed by the educator when the educator created the course), and receive a verifiable proof of completion.
Therefore, parents can follow their children academic achievements by simply looking at their children's wallets.

The educators will be incentivised to use the plateform since the educator gets a direct payment throught the minting of his SBT for course completion, which will incentivised good, quality content and courses, and force educators to produce worthy courses.
A leaderboard of educators will keep track of how much money educators were paid by their students, how many courses and tests were created by each educators, ...

Decentralized proof of learning and direct payement of educators throught the blockchain to reward worthy and quality content.

<!-- This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
``` -->
